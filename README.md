# Codon_occupancy_cal
This code is for calculating the relative codon occupancy in the analysis of ribosome profiling data. 

"Codon_occupancy_cal.sh" script acceptes the mapping results (SAM format) and sequence of CDS (Fasta format) as input and outputs the occupancy of each codon. 


This code is under continual development and further updates will be posted here.
